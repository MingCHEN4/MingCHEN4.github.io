#### syntax | sed [options] 's/pattern/replacement/g'  
s means substitute, g means globalises. Above command means replace 'pattern' with 'replacement'. ^ means 'from the start of the string', '.*' means 'try to match as much of the string as possible, '.*/' tries to greedily match anything so long as it's followed by a '/'.  


#### **-i option**  | sed edit in place option, for simpler command use
source from: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18527365/what-does-sed-i-option-do)  

Take file.txt for instance, we want to replace "p" with 0  

`cat file.txt`  
1, 2, "p"  

`sed 's/"p"/0/g' file.txt` # above command simply prints the output into the command line  

you'd like to use '>' to overwrite the file, `sed 's/"p"/0/g' file.txt > file.txt`  

Unfortunately because of the nature of redirects, the above will simply produces a blank file.  

Instead a temp file must be created to do the overwriting. `sed 's/"p"/0/g' file.txt > tmp.txt && mv tmp.txt file.txt`  

Instead of doing the long workaround, the sed in place option '-i' allows for a much simpler command  

`sed -i 's/"p"/0/g' file.txt`
